# ScrapeSpectator 👀

Welcome to ScrapeSpectator! Bridging the gap between web scraping and user interaction, ScrapeSpectator is a unique tool that allows you to not only scrape websites but also visualize the scraping process in real-time. It's like having a front-row seat to the action, watching as the data is extracted and highlighted right before your eyes. 🚀

## Features 🌟

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch as the data is extracted and highlighted in real-time.
- **Interactive Interface**: Navigate through the scraped website with ease.
- **Flexible**: Works with a wide range of websites.
- **Easy to Use**: Just enter the URL and let ScrapeSpectator do the rest.

## How it Works 🛠️

ScrapeSpectator uses a combination of back-end web scraping technologies and front-end visualization techniques to provide a unique, interactive web scraping experience. The back-end server scrapes the website and sends the data to the front-end, which then renders the website and highlights the scraped data.
